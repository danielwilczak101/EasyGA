# EasyGA - A general solution to Genetic Algorithms

The projects has just started

## Installation

Run the rolling to install:

```Python
pip3 install EasyGA
```

To use the package
```python
import EasyGA
```

## Usage
```python
import random
import EasyGA

# The user defined function
def user_gene_function():
    return random.randint(1, 100)

# Standard user size requirements
Population_size = 10
Chromosome_length = 10

# Create the Genetic algorithm
ga = EasyGA.GA(Population_size, Chromosome_length,user_gene_function)
ga.initialize()

# Looking at the first chromosome in the population
print(ga.population.chromosomes[0].print_chromosome())

```

# Developing EasyGA
Download the repository to some folder - If you never used git. Look up a youtube tutorial. It will all make sense.
```
git clone https://github.com/danielwilczak101/EasyGA.git
```
Then install the repositroy using this command:
```
pip install -e .
```

# Working on developing a devel branch
To install EASY, along with the tools you need to develop and run tests, run the following in your virtual env:

```bash
$ pip install -e .[devel]
```
